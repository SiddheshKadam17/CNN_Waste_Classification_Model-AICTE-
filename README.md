# CNN_Waste_Classification_Model-AICTE-
This is my AICTE Virtual Internship

This repository contains a deep learning-based waste classification model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The goal of this project is to classify waste into two categories: Organic (O) and Recyclable (R) by analyzing images of waste materials.

The dataset is organized into a folder structure as follows:

Waste_Classification/
│-- TRAIN/  
│   ├── Organic/  
│   └── Recyclable/  
│  
│-- TEST/  
│   ├── Organic/  
│   └── Recyclable/
